## Installation & Quick Start

To run the frontend application locally, follow these precise steps:

1. **Navigate to the Frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install all required packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the `frontend` folder and populate it (see section below).

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *The server will start on `http://localhost:5173`. Make sure the backend server is also running to populate data.*

## Pages & Routes

### Public / Customer Routes

| Route | Page | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `Home.jsx` | Marketing homepage with Hero and Call to Actions. |
| `/login` | `Login.jsx` | User authentication via HTTP-Only cookies. |
| `/register` | `Register.jsx` | User account creation. |
| `/menu` | `Menu.jsx` | Publicly viewable weekly menu page. |

### Protected Customer Routes
| Route | Page | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | `user/Dashboard.jsx` | Core hub displaying wallet balance, meals left, and today's delivery state. |
| `/skip-meal` | `user/SkipMeal.jsx` | Interactive calendar to pause delivery and refund credits. |
| `/profile` | `user/Profile.jsx` | Form to update details and upload an avatar. |
| `/wallet` | `user/Wallet.jsx` | Interface to add funds. |
| `/transactions` | `user/Transactions.jsx` | View ledger of past wallet deductions and recharges. |
| `/subscription` | `user/Subscription.jsx` | Subscription status and renewal portal. |
| `/support` | `user/Support.jsx` | User support ticketing/contact page. |
| `/weekly-menu` | `user/WeeklyMenu.jsx` | Authenticated view of the upcoming meals. |

### Admin Routes (Guarded)

| Route | Page | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/admin` | `admin/Dashboard.jsx` | Aggregated analytics with Recharts graphs. |
| `/admin/users` | `admin/Users.jsx` | Directory of all users, their wallets, and active states. |
| `/admin/menu` | `admin/MenuEditor.jsx` | UI to upload daily menus to Cloudinary. |
| `/admin/reports` | `admin/Reports.jsx` | Log of automated billing runs and deduction totals. |
| `/admin/low-balance` | `admin/LowBalanceUsers.jsx` | Real-time monitoring of users needing a wallet recharge. |

> **Route Guards:** `<ProtectedRoute>` securely redirects non-authenticated users to `/login`. `<AdminRoute>` completely blocks standard users from loading the admin components.

## Core Components

### `SkipMeal` (Calendar)
The core scheduling tool for client users. Built with `date-fns` and full-calendar systems to render a customizable monthly viewport.
- Past calendar cells are locked and read-only.
- The cutoff validation engine visually locks the *current* day if the daily logistics preparation window has closed.
- Integrates status markers showing delivered meals with confirmation checkmarks, and cancelled meals with skip indicators.

### `Navbar`
A dual-state responsive header. For guests, it shows login options. For authenticated users, it displays wallet balance, an avatar dropdown, and navigation links.

---

## Core Architecture

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The routing layer heavily utilizes `<ProtectedRoute>` and `<AdminRoute>` wrapper components. Standard users are physically prevented from accessing admin routes, ensuring that sensitive data and UI elements are completely gated off from unauthorized access.

### 2. Hydration & Global State (`useAuthStore`)
Instead of directly hydrating the UI from volatile `localStorage` (which causes UI flickering and security flaws), the app relies on the `authStore.js` (Zustand) to securely hydrate the session via the backend's `/auth/check` endpoint utilizing HTTP-Only cookies. A global `isCheckingAuth` spinner handles the brief loading state gracefully.

### 3. Axios Interceptor
All API requests flow through a centralized Axios instance configured with `withCredentials: true`. This guarantees the browser silently attaches the secure JWT session cookie to every outbound request.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in this `/frontend` directory before starting the application:

```env
# The URL where your backend API is running
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## Future Frontend Roadmap: Delivery Agent Portal & Order Tracking

* **Delivery Agent Portal**: A dedicated set of responsive routes under `/delivery/*` (e.g., Dashboard, Active Deliveries, Earnings Ledger) specifically optimized for mobile-first viewports.
* **Real-time Order Tracker**: A consumer tracking dashboard with a visual step-by-step progress stepper (from kitchen preparation through dispatch and completion).
* **Live Maps Integration**: Integrating Mapbox or Google Maps API to show the active delivery agent's route and delivery progress dynamically.
* **State Syncing via WebSockets**: Integrating `socket.io-client` with Zustand to update order logs and notify both agents and customers without full-page reloads.

## Design System

MealOra uses a curated, appetizing design language aimed at feeling premium and welcoming.

### Typography
- **Headings & Body:** Modern sans-serif stacks (Inter, system-ui) optimized for high legibility.

### Theming & Animations
- **Colors:** Deep branding hues (warm oranges and earth browns) mixed with stark whites and subtle grays to make food imagery pop.
- **Micro-interactions:** Extensive use of `hover:`, `transition-all`, and **Framer Motion** ensures every button click, page load, and modal pop-in feels alive and responsive.
- **Forms:** Controlled components with clear, real-time error states, utilizing Tailwind's `focus:ring` utilities to guide the user seamlessly through onboarding.
